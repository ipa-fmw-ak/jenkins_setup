# 5. IPA Configuration

## 5.1 Robotic Operating System

Install **ROS** following **[this](https://github.com/ipa-fmw-ak/Administration/wiki/05.-ROS-Guide)** Guide.

## 5.2 Master

### 5.2.1 Create Cob-Pipeline Configuration Folder

All configurations should be stored in a common folder in the `$HOME` folder called `jenkins-config`.

    mkdir ~/jenkins-config


### 5.2.2 Git Configuration

Set up the GitHub user. This user has to have read-access to all repositories to build and write access to your **jenkins_config** repository.

    git config --global user.name "<USER_NAME>"
    git config --global user.email "<EMAIL>"


### 5.2.3 jenkins_config Repository

Clone the **jenkins_config** repository into the `jenkins-config` folder.

    git clone git@github.com:ipa320/jenkins_config.git ~/jenkins-config/jenkins_config


### 5.2.4 jenkins_setup Repository

Clone the **jenkins_setup** repository into the `jenkins-config` folder.

    git clone git@github.com:ipa320/jenkins_setup.git ~/jenkins-config/jenkins_setup


### 5.2.5 PYTHONPATH

Add the **jenkins_setup** module to the `$PYTHONPATH`.

    echo "export PYTHONPATH=~/jenkins-config/jenkins_setup/src" > /etc/profile.d/python_path.sh
    echo "source /opt/ros/<ROS_RELEASE>/setup.sh" >> /etc/profile.d/python_path.sh

Afterwards reboot the Jenkins-Server!


### 5.2.6 Tarball Server

The **Tarball-Server** stores all the chroot tarball which will be used during the build process. It can be the Jenkins master or another server. In both cases you have to create a `chroot_tarballs` folder in `$HOME` which contains another folder where the used chroot tarballs will be stored.

    mkdir -p ~/chroot_tarballs/in_use_on__<JENKINS_MASTER_NAME>


## 5.3 Slave

### 5.3.1 Sudo Rights

    sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers

and add to the file:

    jenkins    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL


### 5.3.2 SSH Access

    ssh-copy-id <master>    # _on slave_
    ssh <master>            # _on slave_
    ssh-copy-id <slave>     # _on master_


### 5.3.3 Pbuilder

    sudo apt-get install pbuilder devscripts

**Performance Improvement**

For configurations a file called **~/.pbuilderrc** in the slaves `$HOME` folder is needed, `/etc/pbuilder/pbuilderrc` is an alternative.

**Pbuilders aptcache**

The aptcach of pbuilder is very useful but when the cache is getting bigger gradually it takes quite a while to open a chroot from the tarball. If you don't want to use it (for instance if you use an external apt-cacher), add the following to `~/.pbuilderrc`:


    # don't use aptcache
    APTCACHE=""

**Use ccache for build**

To use ccache inside the pbuilder add the following to `~/.pbuilderrc`:

    # ccache
    sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/pbuilder/ccache
    sudo chmod a+w /var/cache/pbuilder/ccache
    export CCACHE_DIR="/var/cache/pbuilder/ccache"
    export PATH="/usr/lib/ccache:${PATH}"
    EXTRAPACKAGES=ccache
    BINDMOUNTS="${CCACHE_DIR}"

**Use multi-core zipping**

To speed up the zipping and unzipping of the chroot tarball's, install **pigz**.

    sudo apt-get install pigz

And add the following to `~/.pbuilderrc`:

    # pigz; multicore zipping
    COMPRESSPROG=pigz

**Mount memory to run the pbuilder chroots in it**

Installations and builds inside the chroot need quite a lot write accesses. If you don't have a SSD installed, you can use the memory for this. Therefore you have to create a filesystem in your RAM, using `tmpfs` by adding the following to the slaves `/etc/fstab`:

    # pbuilder
    tmpfs   /var/cache/pbuilder/build   tmpfs   defaults,size=32000M    0   0

The size depends on the size of the chroot you will work with (at least 3G... more is better). It can be larger then the RAM size. If the chroot size exceeds the RAM size it will use the SWAP as well.

Additionally you have to add the following to `~/pbuilderrc`:

    # tmpfs
    APTCACHEHARDLINK=no

Finally mount `tmpfs` by entering (as root):

    mount -a

### 5.3.4 Slave setup on Master
**TODO!!!**


## 5.4 The Cob-Pipeline

For the usage of the **Cob-Pipeline** three parts are necessary:

* **[Cob-Pipeline PlugIn](https://github.com/fmw-jk/cob-pipeline-plugin)**

> This plugin allows the user to configure its individual build/test pipeline via the Jenkins web interface. Afterwards the automatic generation of the pipeline can be triggered.

* **[jenkins_setup repository](https://github.com/ipa320/jenkins_setup)**

> This repository has to be available on the Jenkins-Server. It includes the code for the pipeline generation.

* **[jenkins_config repository](https://github.com/ipa320/jenkins_config)**

> In this repository all the pipeline configurations are stored.

### 5.4.1 Install the Cob-Pipeline

Download the **[.hpi](https://github.com/fmw-jk/cob-pipeline-plugin/releases)** and place it in `/var/jenkins-data/plugins`.

    cd /var/jenkins-data/plugins
    sudo wget https://github.com/fmw-jk/cob-pipeline-plugin/releases/download/v0.9.5-alpha/cob-pipeline.hpi

Restart your Jenkins-Server

    /etc/init.d/jenkins restart

### 5.4.2 Configure the Cob-Pipeline

Go to the **Cob Pipeline Configuration** section. The following fields are all required for the use.

* **Jenkins Admin Login/Password**

> This is the user you configured before in the Configure Security part with all the permissions. Enter its login name and password.
    
* **Configuration Folder**
    
> Enter the path of the Cob-Pipeline configuration folder.
    
* **Tarball Location**
    
> Enter the location where the tarballs are stored.
    
* **GitHub User Login/Password**
    
> This is the user that has read-permission to all the repositories you want to be tested. It has also write-permission to your jenkins-config repository.
    
* **Pipeline Repositories Owner/Fork**
    
> GitHub user that ownes the ^jenkins_setup^ and the ^jenkins_config^ repository.
    
* **ROS Releases**
    
> ROS versions that should be supported by your build/test pipeline.
    
* **Robots**
    
> Nodes which can be chosen for Hardware Build/Test jobs.
    
* **Target Platform URL**
    
> URL where the ROS **targets.yaml** is stored, defining the Ubuntu target platforms for each **ROS** Version, e.g..

_When you fill out the fields, the values will be validated in the background._
